    "description": `This space is incredible! The view alone is worth the cost of the room, as well as the incredibly stocked kitchen and wonderful shared spaces like the bathrooms and terrace. This place was absolutely stunning. I would definitely try to stay here again if/when I'm in Amsterdam!`,

    "description": `The listing and home was just as described and Giovanni did a great job of welcoming me into his home with a personal tour. The apartment shared a kitchen and bathroom with other rooms but you felt private and alone in your individual rooms. The vibe was cozy and well lit, raw wood, natural light and green shrubs highlighted the room. The view on the 14th floor was beautiful and expansive overlooking downtown Amsterdam. I would definitely recommend this stay to others and I look forward to coming back to Amsterdam in this exact location.`,
